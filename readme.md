# Graphs

All the graphs are based out of general graph algorithms like depicted below:

Rather than studying individual graph algorithms, study the general graph algorithms.

## Graph [vertices and edges]

In the above diagram:
--------------
a,b,c,d are vertices

c-d is a path [which is also called an edge]

c-b is not a valid path

a-b-c-d is a cycle


Examples of directed graph:

1. googles webcorpus where each webpage is a vertex and an edge from webpage a to webpage b, if a has a hyperlink to b
2. twitter, where edge if from person a to b if a follows b on twitter.
3. a road network within  a city with lots of one way streets. 

Below is not a directed graph, it is an undirected graph:

a graph of social media, edge from person a to b if
